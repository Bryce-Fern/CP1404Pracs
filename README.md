- Classes are amazing, nothing else to say
- Using appropriate naming conventions (e.g. for language in languages - you know it's talking about languages) can help interpret things easier and makes backtracking to past coding less of a hassle to understand
- Using functions to reduce code repeats to keep things less repetitive and to use function names in place of the original code drastically reduces the time spent overall on each python file
